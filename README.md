Predicting Survivability of Titanic Passenger

In the titanic.R file, I write a code to predict survivability of Titanic Passenger. 
I use the dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heptapod/titanic

In the code I use four different machine learning techniques:
  1. Logistic Regression 
  2. Support Vector Machine
  3. Decision Tree
  4. Random Forest

I also include the tuning method for SVM and RF in the code.

The result shows that Random Forest yields the best result in terms of accuracy (80%).
